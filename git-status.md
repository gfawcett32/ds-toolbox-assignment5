Definition: git status
The git status command provides an overview of the current state of the working directory and staging area, highlighting changes that are staged for commit, modified, or untracked. It also shows the active branch and offers suggestions for next steps, like staging changes or committing.
In order to access the same information in JupyterLab, you'll need to review the Git panel.
